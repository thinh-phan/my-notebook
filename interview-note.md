```
If input array is sorted then
- Binary search
- Two pointers

If asked for all permutations/subsets then
- Backtracking

If given a tree then
- DFS
Backtracking, complete search, exhausting all possible paths
- BFS
Check if a path exists between nodes, finding "hops" distance out or "levels" away

If given a graph then
- DFS
- BFS

If given a linked list then
- Two pointers

If recursion is banned then
- Stack

If must solve in-place then
- Swap corresponding values
- Store one or more different values in the same pointer

If asked for maximum/minumum subarray/subset/options then
- Dynamic programming

If asked for top/least K items then
- Heap

If asked for common strings then
- Map
- Trie

Else
- Map/Set for O(1) time & O(n) space
- Sort input for O(nlogn) time and O(1) space

Sliding window
- fixed length
 Max sum subarry of size k
- dynamic variant
Smallest sum larger to some value s
- dynamic variant w/ auxiliary data structure
Longest substring w/ no more than k distinct characters
String permutations
- commonalities
Everything grouped sequentially
Longest / smallest / contains / max / min
```
